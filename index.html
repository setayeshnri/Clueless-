        Clueless is a 1995 American coming-of-age teen comedy film written and
        directed by Amy Heckerling. It stars Alicia Silverstone with supporting
        roles by Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy and Paul Rudd (in his film debut).
        It was produced by Scott Rudin and Robert Lawrence. It is loosely based
        on Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma, with a modern-day setting of Beverly
        Hills. The plot centers on a beautiful, popular, and rich high school
        student who befriends a new student and decides to give her a makeover
        while playing a matchmaker for her teachers and examining her own
        existence.

        Clueless was filmed in California over a 40-day schedule. The film's
        director studied Beverly Hills high school students to understand how
        teenagers in the 1990s talked and learned some appropriate slang terms
        from them. The film grossed $56.1 million in the United States. It has
        received positive reviews from critics and is considered to be one of
        the best teen films of all time. Clueless has developed a cult following
        and has a continuing legacy. The film was followed by a spin-off
        television sitcom and series of books.

      <h2>Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Cher Horowitz is a stylish, good-natured, and popular teenager living in
        a Beverly Hills mansion with her wealthy father Mel, a gruff litigator;
        her mother died during a liposuction procedure when Cher was a baby. She
        attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend Dionne
        Davenport, who is also beautiful and from a wealthy family. Dionne has a
        long-term relationship with popular student Murray Duvall, though Cher
        believes Dionne should be dating more mature men. Josh, the socially
        conscious son of Mel's ex-wife of only a few weeks, visits Cher and her
        father during a break from college. She playfully mocks his idealism,
        while he teases her for her vanity and superficial lifestyle. After
        receiving a poor grade, Cher decides to orchestrate a romance between
        two teachers at her school, Miss. Geist and the hard-grading Mr. Hall,
        so that Hall will relax his standards and allow Cher to renegotiate the
        grade. After seeing their newfound happiness, Cher realizes that she
        enjoys doing good deeds. When a "clueless" transfer student named Tai
        Frasier arrives at the school, Cher decides to make Tai her next project
        by giving her a makeover with the help of Dionne, providing Tai with
        confidence and a sense of style. Cher tries to extinguish the attraction
        between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable but clumsy slacker, and
        instead steer Tai towards handsome, popular student Elton. However,
        Elton has no interest in Tai and instead tries to make out with Cher in
        his car after a party. When she rebuffs him, he leaves her in a parking
        lot out of spite and she is mugged at gunpoint. Josh picks her up and
        the two begin to bond. Fashion-conscious new student Christian attracts
        Cher's attention and becomes her target for a boyfriend. When she goes
        to a party with him, Josh becomes jealous and decides to follow her to
        the party. She invites Christian to her home and tries to seduce him,
        but he deflects her advances. Murray subsequently tells Cher and Dionne
        that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of her romantic overtures,
        Cher remains friends with Christian due to her admiration of his taste
        in art and fashion. Cher's privileged life takes a negative turn when
        Tai's newfound popularity strains their relationship, and when she fails
        her driving test and cannot change the result. When Cher returns home in
        a depressed mood, Tai confesses that she has feelings for Josh and asks
        Cher for help in pursuing him. Cher says Tai is not right for Josh,
        leading to the two girls falling out. Feeling "totally clueless", Cher
        reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or
        appreciate the people in her life. After thinking about why she is
        bothered by Tai's romantic interest in Josh, Cher finally realizes that
        she is in love with him. In response to her epiphany, Cher begins making
        awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including
        captaining the school's Pismo Beach disaster relief effort. She accepts
        an invitation by Travis to a skating tournament where she reconciles
        with Tai. Cher and Josh eventually follow through on their feelings for
        one another, culminating in a kiss. Ultimately, her friendships with Tai
        and Dionne are solidified. Sometime later, Mr. Hall and Miss. Geist get
        married, and Cher attends the wedding with Josh, Dionne, Murray, and Tai
        and Travis (who have begun dating). Cher catches the wedding bouquet,
        and she and Josh embrace and kiss. Cast See also: List of Clueless

        Reitman as student Production Development The idea for Clueless first
        originated as a television pilot in 1993. Writer and director Amy
        Heckerling said: "Twentieth Century Fox said they wanted a show about
        teenagers—but not the nerds. They wanted it to be about the cool kids.
        The most successful character in anything I'd ever done was Jeff Spicoli
        in Fast Times. People think that's because he was stoned and a surfer.
        But that's not it. It's because he's positive. So I thought, 'I'm going
        to write a character who's positive and happy.' And that was Cher."
        Heckerling, having read the Jane Austen novel Emma in college and loving
        the title character's positivity, decided to write the script around an
        Emma-like character, saying, "I started to think, 'What's the larger
        context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through
        rose colored glasses' kind of girl? So I tried to take all the things
        that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be
        like if it was in Beverly Hills. I remembered reading Emma in college
        and being struck at how much it reminded me of old TV shows like Gidget.
        There's something so basic about it. I knew [Clueless] would be set in
        Beverly Hills because it's a hyper-pastel fantasy place." —writer and
        director Amy Heckerling in 2012 As research for the script, Heckerling
        sat in on classes at Beverly Hills High School to get a feel for the
        student culture, commenting, "...one thing I observed was these girls in
        a constant state of grooming."Ken Stovitz had become Heckerling's agent
        at the time and told her the script had the potential to be a feature
        film after he read it. The finished script, which was titled "No
        Worries", contained the main characters that would end up in the
        Clueless film. Twink Caplan, Heckerling's friend who had worked with her
        on past projects, said film executives at Fox were wary of the story
        being too female-oriented to appeal to a large enough audience. "It was
        obvious they didn't get it. They thought the script needed more boys in
        it. They were afraid that if they focused on girls, we wouldn't get any
        guys to see it. So it went into turnaround. It was dead", said Caplan.
        Six months later, the script found its way to producer Scott Rudin, who
        gave it his stamp of approval. Rudin's support led to increased interest
        in the script, and it became the subject of a bidding war between
        studios which was eventually won by Paramount Pictures. Heckerling was
        excited, as Paramount owned several major youth-centered TV channels,
        such as MTV and Nickelodeon, which were suited to the film's target
        demographic.
