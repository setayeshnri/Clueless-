        Clueless is a 1995 American coming-of-age teen comedy film written and
        directed by Amy Heckerling. It stars Alicia Silverstone with supporting
        roles by Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy and Paul Rudd (in his film debut).
        It was produced by Scott Rudin and Robert Lawrence. It is loosely based
        on Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma, with a modern-day setting of Beverly
        Hills. The plot centers on a beautiful, popular, and rich high school
        student who befriends a new student and decides to give her a makeover
        while playing a matchmaker for her teachers and examining her own
        existence.

        Clueless was filmed in California over a 40-day schedule. The film's
        director studied Beverly Hills high school students to understand how
        teenagers in the 1990s talked and learned some appropriate slang terms
        from them. The film grossed $56.1 million in the United States. It has
        received positive reviews from critics and is considered to be one of
        the best teen films of all time. Clueless has developed a cult following
        and has a continuing legacy. The film was followed by a spin-off
        television sitcom and series of books.
